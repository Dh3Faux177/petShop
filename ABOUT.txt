You are required to develop a Java EE application that integrates with a relational database system. This project aims to demonstrate your understanding of database integration in enterprise-level applications. Your project must showcase the integration of CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations. The system should follow good design principles by implementing classes and interfaces.

Each system development MUST:
1. Relational Tables: Use at least two relational tables in a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
2. Forms/Pages: Contain at least five forms/pages using Java EE technologies (JSP, Servlets, or JSF).
3. CRUD Operations: Enable creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records from the database through the Java EE interface.
4. Search Functionality: Include a search feature to retrieve specific records from the database.
5. Login System: Implement secure login functionality with encrypted password storage (JEE security features like JAAS).
6. Calculation Feature: Include a feature that performs calculations (e.g., total price, averages) using Java EE’s backend logic.
7. Bug-Free and Efficient: The system must run efficiently with no major bugs and smooth functionality.
8. Class Structure: Proper use of Java EE classes and interfaces to separate business logic from presentation and data access layers.

Ok so here what I proposed for my application: 
•	I want to make Point of Sale for Pet Shop
•	There are 2 roles in this system which are Cashier and Manager
•	Cashier who can only manage the calculation for purchase and can only view product
•	Manager can manage the calculation for purchase, view product, add product, delete product, edit product, add new cashier, edit cashier details, delete cashier and view cashier
•	There will be 3 tables only in database which are manager, cashier and product
•	This will be all my pages:
o	log in page (manager and cashier)
o	Calculation page to make purchase (manager and cashier)
o	Product list page (manager (can delete) and cashier)
o	View product page (manager and cashier)
o	Add new product page (manager)
o	Cashier list (manger (can delete))
o	View Cashier (manager)
o	Edit Cashier (manager)
•	Also include search functionality in Product list and Cashier list page

I will be doing this project by using spring initializer and using these dependencies: spring web, spring boot devtools, thymeleaf, mysql driver, spring data jpa, validation. IDE I’ll be using is IntelliJ
